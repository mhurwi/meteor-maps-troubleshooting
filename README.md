## Troubleshooting a blinking map

The first time you startup this app, it will create 2 shipments, each with a 'lat' and 'lng'.

Navigate to '/' and you will see a map with both markers. The server will automatically update the lat/lng of each shipment every couple seconds, so you will see them move.

Now click a link to show a single shipment.  You will first see the map with the marker, but then the map will blink and the marker will disappear.
